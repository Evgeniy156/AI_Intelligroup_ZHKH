#LEMON DEBUGGING PROTOCOL
1. ANALYZE: Read the error message in the terminal. Identify the specific file and line number.
2. ISOLATE: Determine if the error is a syntax error, logical error, or dependency issue.
3. FIX: Propose a solution that fixes the root cause, not just the symptom.
4. VERIFY: Run the application again to ensure the error is resolved.
